    <h3>Quasont</h3>
    <p>
      This classic croissant recipe is just perfect for a simple and stylish
      breakfast served with coffee. If you are feeling adventurous it is worth
      having a go at making croissants at home. Croissants are made with a yeast
      dough enriched with butter, and the technique of buttering and folding the
      dough gives the classic light and crisp layered finished pastry.

    <h4>Incredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>225g strong plain white flour</li>
      <li>7g sachet easy-blend or fast-action dried yeast</li>
      <li>½tsp salt</li>
      <li>2tsp caster sugar</li>
      <li>90g unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>100ml hand hot water</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift the flour into a large bowl, stir in the yeast, salt and sugar and
        make a well in the centre. Mix together 15g of the butter with the water
        and egg and pour into the well then mix to a dough. Knead for 5-6 mins
        until smooth and elastic. Cover and leave the dough to risen in a warm
        place for 1hr or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Re-knead the dough for 2-3 mins then roll out to a long strip about 30 x
        15cm. Mark the strip widthways into three equal sections. Using a
        palette knife, dot one-third of the remaining butter on to the bottom
        two-thirds of the dough. Fold the bottom third of the dough over the
        middle third then fold down the top third. Seal the edges by pressing
        down firmly with a rolling pin and give the dough a quarter turn. Repeat
        this rolling and folding process twice more, dotting with one-third of
        the butter each time. Wrap loosely in cling film and chill in the fridge
        for 30 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a 22 x 28cm rectangle
        and cut into 8 triangles. Roll each triangle up, from the long edge to
        the point. Form into a crescent shape and place on a large greased
        baking sheet. Cover loosely with oiled cling film and leave in a warm
        place for 30-40 mins until doubled in size
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/Gas Mark 7. Lightly brush the croissants
        with the egg glaze and bake for 20-25 mins until risen and golden. Serve
        warm
