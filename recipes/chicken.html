    <h3>Homemade Chicken Soup</h3>
    <p>
      Homemade chicken soup - but you don't have to be sick to deserve or enjoy
      it - you do, so do! Good for body and soul!
    </p>
    <h4>Incredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
      <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
      <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
      <li>1 large onion, halved</li>
      <li>water to cover</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the chicken, carrots, celery and onion in a large soup pot and cover
        with cold water. Heat and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken meat
        falls off of the bones (skim off foam every so often).
      </li>
      <li>
        Take everything out of the pot. Strain the broth. Pick the meat off of
        the bones and chop the carrots, celery and onion. Season the broth with
        salt, pepper and chicken bouillon to taste, if desired. Return the
        chicken, carrots, celery and onion to the pot, stir together, and serve.
